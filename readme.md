ICS 314/613: Software Engineering (Spring 2022)
ICS 314 (for undergraduates) and ICS 613 (for graduate students) is a fast-paced immersion into significant software engineering concepts and technologies. This website will be used for both courses in Spring 2022, because the same sequence of topics will be used for both courses. At various points in the semester, ICS 613 students will have additional material or be expected to create more sophisticated and/or higher quality deliverables.

Themes
This course includes the following themes:

Software engineering concepts. Classical concepts include requirements, design, implementation, testing, configuration management, development environments, quality assurance, deployment, and project management.

Software engineering technologies. You will explore with a variety of technologies including: the IntelliJ Idea integrated development environment, the git configuration management system, the GitHub project hosting, the Semantic UI user interface framework, and the Meteor web application framework.

Intermediate programming concepts. This course uses JavaScript, which enables you to experience programming concepts including higher-order functions, closures, and functional programming idioms (map, reduce, filter).

Design. You will gain experience with a variety of design domains, including user interface design, application design, data design, security design, and requirements design.

Quality Assurance. The course presents quality assurance concepts including coding standards using ESLint, acceptance testing using TestCafe, and continuous integration using GitHub Actions.

Professional development. The course will help you establish and/or improve your “professional online persona”. This includes: (a) a professional portfolio web site like those at ICS Portfolios; (b) a set of publicly available software projects in which you have participated; (c) a set of well-written technical essays; and (d) participation in professional networking sites such as LinkedIn and TechHui.

Technical writing/WI Focus. The course will help you develop effective strategies for writing, to use and value writing as a tools for learning, and to learn to write in an appropriate manner for software engineering. You will do a substantial amount of writing for this course, well over 16 pages or 4,000 words, and you must adequately complete all writing assignments in order to pass the course with a grade of D or better. For these reasons, this course is designated as a writing intensive course.

Open source software engineering. You will learn some of the fundamental issues involved in successfully developing open source software, as well as the many professional benefits of developing open source software as a student.

Athletic software engineering. This course implements an educational technique called athletic software engineering, which relies heavily on WODs (Workouts of the Day) to help you acquire mastery of the concepts in this course.

The course grounds these thematic elements by covering the skills necessary to quickly build two-tier web applications with a modern look-and-feel. Many computer science and computer engineering projects benefit from a web-based user interface, and this class will help you to create a nice one regardless of your “design” background.

Who should take this course
This course is intended for undergraduates or graduate students in computer science or computer engineering who have a working knowledge of Java or C++ and who want to invest effort into developing their software engineering skill set.

A significant component of the course is a student-selected final project to showcase the techniques learned during the course.

What is the difference between ICS 314, 414, and 613?
There are three software engineering courses in the ICS curriculum.

ICS 314 and ICS 613 are both introductory courses. ICS 613, “Advanced” software engineering, is more accurately an “advanced introduction” to software engineering. This is because we have found that our graduate students vary in their software engineering background, and so it is most helpful to provide them with a software engineering course that does not make any assumptions about their background apart from “computational sophistication”.

ICS 414, on the other hand, has ICS 314 as a prerequisite, and builds directly on the material presented in ICS 314. It is best to take ICS 414 in the semester directly following ICS 314, while the material and tech stack is still fresh.

If you have taken ICS 314 as an undergraduate, and then entered the ICS graduate program, it is not appropriate for you to take ICS 613, as too much of the material will be too similar to what you already learned as an undergraduate.

Pedagogy
ICS 314 is structured as a sequential series of modules, most taking approximately a week to complete. Each module has the following structure:

One or more learning outcomes, describing the major goals for the module.
One or more readings and other online resources, providing background material.
One or more experiential learning activities, providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
Prior results
While ICS software engineering requires discipline and effort, the results appear to be worth the investment. For complete student perspectives on Philip Johnson’s teaching style, please see his unedited course evaluations since 2007, with hundreds of comments (both positive and negative). Here are a few course evaluation comments from recent semesters:

I am not a fan of the “reverse teaching” method but it still worked. Thank you! (Fall, 2021)

Dr. Johnson has, by far, been one of the best professors I have had at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He took a relatively intimidating field and was able to break it down effectively and efficiently. Dr. Johnson is also very understanding and helpful when needed. His positive (and sometimes quirky) attitude made waking up every morning in the middle of a pandemic a little bit more bearable. I do not think I would have had such a positive experience in this class had it not been with him. (Spring, 2021)

This class makes feel SO excited for my future. 314 really prepared you for real world experiences. I feel more confident for the first time ever and it’s my fourth year at UH. (Fall, 2020)

The work load is a lot but it’s really fun to see the possibilities that can be done because of it. I enjoyed the course and never felt burdened to do any of the coding assignments because it was so engaging. As long as you keep doing the assignments you are supposed to, you can stay on track and learn efficiently. Its broken down concepts that you gradually learn and by the end, you come out with a great amount of knowledge than before. This is probably one of the best courses you’ll take as it will apply far beyond school. (Spring, 2020)

Professor Johnson’s course is the course that breaks open the field for students, in my opinion. He provides us the tools to effectively collaborate as a team when working with code and how to make the modern designs that we see today in sites. This course is definitely something I dreaded while taking, since the work load can be a little much at times, but if you properly try to understand how everything works, the knowledge gained can stay with you for life. It’s honestly insane. (Fall, 2019)

Overall, the course takes a different direction than the typical class would. The course is similar to conditioning yourself for a sport. It takes a lot of time and effort from the student initially, but as time goes on, the results show. At the start of the course, the time pressure of the assignments made me tense and clumsy, but the practices and material provided helped steel me into a LEAN, MEAN, FIERCE COMPUTER ATHLETE, WHO DOESN’T FLINCH AT THE SIGHT OF A WOD. The project period is also a time of revelation. (Spring, 2018)

On the other hand, some students find the workload to be stressful, as shown by this comment:

A very spirited instructor, sometimes too spirited. The constant requirements for the class both with studying materials and programming can be overwhelming to a student of typical course & out of school load (other classes and work/family obligations). (Fall, 2009)
